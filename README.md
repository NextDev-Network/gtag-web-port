# The one of the first (or the first) web ports for Gorilla tag

This web-port made by Road.js and Veteraning of gorilla tag to play in school or in other places only in html. This makes it easier to enjoy games. 

### Why did you make this?

We made this to expand the landscape of game ports and availability of games to play. Also because its so fucking funny that we released our webport before bog 

### How long did it take?

a bit tbh but not too long. was worth it

### how the fcuk does this work?

basically we modified the main vr mode and made it so you can use wasd and space to jump. it is kinda broken but better than putting goggles on and starting to jump around the class
